# Solitaire

A simple solitaire implementation for now

## What needs to be done

- Set the background colour green
- Build basic layout with shadows and spacing showing the board without any cards
- Render the cards out with DND but no functionality
- Check a card can be dropped before allowing the action to continue
- Increment the score when a new card is revealed or when the card is added to the final pile
- Add fancy animation for card switching
- Add fancy animation for winning
- Add "Enter your name" to be added to the leaderboard
- Add leaderboard page
- Add settings page
